# Anchor — Plugin Development Context

Anchor is a Cowork plugin that gives Claude two journaling skills: daily capture and monthly reflection. Entries are stored as plain markdown files in a user-specified folder.

**Core design principle:** text records should reconstruct lived experience, not summarise it.

## Decision logs

- `decisions-system.md` — confirmed design decisions for file structure, metadata, and workflow. The most granular record.
- `product/strategy/decisions-product.md` — product and feature decisions: what to build, defer, or rule out.

At the end of any product or system work session, check whether decisions were made or surfaced and prompt the maintainer to log them if not already captured.

## Public/private boundary

This is the public product/plugin repo. Real journal entries, monthlies, private archive exports, and Anchor session logs belong in the private sibling repo `../anchor-data/`.

Use this repo for public plugin work, public docs, roadmap/product strategy, fictional examples, and open-source maintenance. Use `../anchor-data/` for the live journal data layer and logs about Anchor data-layer work.

## Skill development conventions

Each skill lives in its own folder with a single `SKILL.md` file. Skills are written as plain instructions Claude reads at the start of a task. Skills are self-contained — all rules, structures, and conventions live within the skill file itself.

When writing or modifying skills:
- Read `decisions-system.md` before making changes — it is the authoritative record of current system design
- Preserve the user's voice in all entry handling — do not paraphrase or smooth out content
